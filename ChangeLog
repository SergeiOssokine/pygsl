2005-06-01  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@sourceforge.net>
	* Fixed an off by one error in the siman module
	
2005-04-04  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@sourceforge.net>
	* input1 was used as second input in functions
	  PyGSL_statistics_d_AA, PyGSL_statistics_d_AAd, PyGSL_statistics_d_AAdd
 	   Fixed.	
	* removed a tangling goto in PyGSL_statistics_d_AA

2005-1-22  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Changed the build process. Will read the last selection
	   for numarray/Numeric if already made. If not, looks which
	   one it can import, and this it will use. Preference is 
	   Numeric. You can make a selection on the command line using
	   --array-object=Numeric|numarray.

2005-1     Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Added switchable debug prints for the C modules
	     Compile the software with debug=1. Then you can 
	     use pygsl.init.set_debug_level() to switch the 
             debug prints off and on
	
2004-12    Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Added fft module
	   
	
2004-04    Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	   * Added support for numarray. Now numarray
	     can be defined at compile time and numarray
	     conversion routines are used internally.

2004-03-24 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>,
           Eric Gurrola, Peter Stoltz
	* Moved common functions to one python module to support the 
	  MAC OSX platform
	* Rewrite of the statistics module. Moved common functions to 
	  one module. Made them generic and changed the macros to use these
	  generic functions.
	
2004-01-09 Leonardo Milano
	* Added support for rpm generation
	
2003-12-27  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
        * Reimplementation of the siman module
	
2003-12-22  Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added Monte Carlo support    
	
2003-12-17 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* error return codes are translated to python exceptions internally.
	  This changed the API for many functions
	  
2003-12-16 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
        * Reimplementation of the rng module supporting internal sampling.
           moved to main tree

2003-12-11 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Clean up of the diff module:
	  -- Added checks of the return values of the python callback
	  -- Simplified the code
	  -- Thread safety
	   
2003-05-25 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added build support for platforms without a shell
	
2003-10-5   Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	* Added translation of the GSL error number code into the approbriate
	  python exception.

2003-06-03 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
        * combined all helper functions in a library.
	* added support for Monte Carlo Integration and Combination. 
	* added methods to the permutation. Moved the tolist method to a C 
	  implementation.
	* Fixed a bug in the error reporting of the float conversion routine.
	* added Hankel transform support
	* Fixed the spline implementation (was using the interpolation 
	  implementation instead of the spline implementation)
	
2003-05-18  Achim Gädke  <achim.gaedke@physik.tu-darmstadt.de>

	* now checked in several changes to create a new release.
	  activated all available modules, updated README.html

2003-02-09 Pierre Schnizer <schnizer@users.sourceforge.net>
	
        * src/poly, src/callback, src/gslwrap : added these directories, which
 	  provide low level wrapper interface files for swig. These provide low
	  level interfaces for polynomial, blas, eigen, linalg, integration, 
	  root finding, minimization, multi roots finding, chebychev series
	  multi dimensional non linear fit
	
	* pygsl/blas.py, pygsl/eigen.py pygsl/linalg.py 
	  These wrappers were written by Fabian Jakobs.

	* pygsl/
	
	* Makefile : added. It is only used for developing the swig wrappers.

2003-03-07  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@jochen-kuepper.de>

	* gsl_Extension.py (gsl_Extension.get_gsl_version): Remove final '+'
	from version string. This is used by GSL for cvs versions, these are
	now treated analogous to the previous release.


2002-01-27  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@jochen-kuepper.de>

	* gsl_Extension.py (gsl_Extension.__init__): Set additional macro
	NUMERIC to 0 or 1 according to the availablity of NumPy. This
	macro can be used as boolean flag in code.


	* Local Variables:
	* mode: auto-fill
	* fill-column: 79
	* End:
