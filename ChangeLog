        * combined all helper functions in a library.
	* added support for Monte Carlo Integration and Combination. 
	* added methods to the permutation. Moved the tolist method to a C 
	  implementation.
	* Fixed a bug in the error reporting of the float conversion routine.
	* added Hankel transform support
	* Fixed the spline implementation (was using the interpolation 
	  implementation instead of the spline implementation)

	* now checked in several changes to create a new release.
	  activated all available modules, updated README.html

        * src/poly, src/callback, src/gslwrap : added these directories, which
 	  provide low level wrapper interface files for swig. These provide low
	  level interfaces for polynomial, blas, eigen, linalg, integration, 
	  root finding, minimization, multi roots finding, chebychev series
	  multi dimensional non linear fit
	
	* pygsl/blas.py, pygsl/eigen.py pygsl/linalg.py 
	  These wrappers were written by Fabian Jakobs.

	* pygsl/
	
	* Makefile : added. It is only used for developing the swig wrappers.

	* gsl_Extension.py (gsl_Extension.get_gsl_version): Remove final '+'
	from version string. This is used by GSL for cvs versions, these are
	now treated analogous to the previous release.


2002-01-27  Jochen Küpper  <jochen@jochen-kuepper.de>

	* gsl_Extension.py (gsl_Extension.__init__): Set additional macro
	NUMERIC to 0 or 1 according to the availablity of NumPy. This
	macro can be used as boolean flag in code.


	* Local Variables:
	* mode: auto-fill
	* fill-column: 79
	* End:
