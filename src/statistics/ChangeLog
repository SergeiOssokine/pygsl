	* functions.c (All function macro implementations): Add a test for
	NumPy as first part of the if-clause trying to parse a real NumPy
	array. This way the compiler optimizes it away in the non-NumPy case
	(or at least never performs any of the code -- I hope you are
	debugging, otherwise its a crappy compiler:).

	* all: first complete working implementation. Submodules char, uchar,
	short, int, long, float, and double are available and work with
	NumPy. Other datatypes are not provided by NumPy.  There are some
	remaining problems with the non-NumPy implementation, to be resolved:)


	* Local Variables:
	* mode: auto-fill
	* fill-column: 79
	* End:
