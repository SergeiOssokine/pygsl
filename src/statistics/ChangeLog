	* input1 was used as second input in functions
	  PyGSL_statistics_d_AA, PyGSL_statistics_d_AAd, PyGSL_statistics_d_AAdd
 	   Fixed.	This affected the following functions:
	   wmean, wvariance, wvariance_m, wsd, wsd_m
	  wvariance_with_fixed_mean, wsd_with_fixed_mean,
	  wabsdev, wabsdev_m, wskew, wskew_m_sd, wkurtosis
	  wkurtosis_m_sd

	* removed a tangling goto in PyGSL_statistics_d_AA

	* Rewrite of the statistics module. Moved common functions to 
	  one module. Made them generic and changed the macros to use these
	  generic functions.

	* functions.c (All function macro implementations): Add a test for
	NumPy as first part of the if-clause trying to parse a real NumPy
	array. This way the compiler optimizes it away in the non-NumPy case
	(or at least never performs any of the code -- I hope you are
	debugging, otherwise its a crappy compiler:).

	* all: first complete working implementation. Submodules char, uchar,
	short, int, long, float, and double are available and work with
	NumPy. Other datatypes are not provided by NumPy.  There are some
	remaining problems with the non-NumPy implementation, to be resolved:)


	* Local Variables:
	* mode: auto-fill
	* fill-column: 79
	* End:
