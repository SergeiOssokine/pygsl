This chapter describes the statistical functions in the library.  The basic
statistical functions include routines to compute the mean, variance and
standard deviation. More advanced functions allow you to calculate absolute
deviations, skewness, and kurtosis as well as the median and arbitrary
percentiles.  The algorithms use recurrence relations to compute average
quantities in a stable way, without large intermediate values that might
overflow.

All functions work on any Python sequence (of appropriate data-type), but see
section \ref{sec:stat-speed-considerations} for advantages and drawbacks of
different kinds of input data.

\section{Organization of the module}
\label{sec:stat-organization}

The parts of the \gsl{} functions names, providing artificial name spaces, are
mapped to modules and submodules in \pygsl{}.  That is \code{gsl_stats_mean}
can be found as \code{pygsl.statistics.mean} and \code{gsl_stats_long_mean} as
\code{pygsl.statistics.long.mean}.

The functions in the module are available in versions for datasets in the
standard floating-point and integer types. The generic versions available in
the \code{pygsl.statistics} module are using the generic \gsl{} \code{double}
versions.  The submodules use \gsl{} functions according to the submodule name,
e.g. long for \code{pygsl.statistics.long}.

Currently implemented submodules are \code{pygsl.statistics.double} and
\code{pygsl.statistics.long}.



\section{Speed considerations}
\label{sec:stat-speed-considerations}

All functions work on any Python sequence type but are optimized for use with
\NUMPY{} (\numpy{}) arrays. It is strongly suggested that you install NumPy
(available from \url{http://www.numpy.org}).

If you pass NumPy arrays of the \emph{correct data-type} as input data
to any of the functions they are passed straight to the C functions
along with the stride information of the data.

If you pass generic (non-\numpy{}) Python sequences or \numpy{} arrays of the
wrong data-type a suitable copy of the data will be created and passed to the
function.
